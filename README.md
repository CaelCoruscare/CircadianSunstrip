# CircadianSunstrip
This is a side project I did while in college. It will set an RGBW LED strip to change colors to match the sun outside.

A couple months after I finished it, a product hit the market that does the same thing, so I never ended up following through. One day I'd like to come back and create a more comprehensive system for controlling multiple lights and light sources throughout a house. Leaving this up for that day.
